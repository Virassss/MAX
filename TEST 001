Previously,for high security areas or in locker rooms for banks, traditional lock systems, passwords, etc., were employed.
However, these systems were found to be not perfectly secure. The purpose of this project is to provide high security for such high end
security applications and to design a smart door access system using finger print module. The use of this device is to provide access to 
only authorized persons. Both hardware and software technology are used to design it. An emergency beep sound is provided to protect the
system by giving alarm if any unauthorized person intrudes into the system. 
An indicator indicates for any emergency condition. Motors are used for locking and unlocking the door.
